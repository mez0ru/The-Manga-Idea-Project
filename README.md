# Manga Idea
This project is still under development.
I know how cringy the name is, but I'm bad at naming, so I will change it later.

# Objective
I'm quite fond of Komga, the manga server. However, as much as I like it, it's a memory hog. \
There's probably ways around this issue, but I kind of wanted to dabble with the C++ stack. \
I plan on working on this in my free time, acheiving almost the same functionality that Komga provides eventually.

# Advantages
I don't want to sound mean to Komga, it's actually really good and I don't think I will ever beat the functionalities it provides.\
However, this project only needs 2-3 mb of memory when Idle. Extreme load probably 100-200 mb. I haven't tested it a lot yet. \
But either way it's margins more memory efficient than Komga. Even a go project will at least be 5 times more memory ineffient than C++.

# Status
This is a pet project, which means, I will probably work on what I'm interested in adding, working on what I need. \
Either way this is just to help me learn C++, I plan on making it as similar as Komga. But don't expect too much. \
But I think this is showing a great promise, as I can do tricks that Komga won't do, like on-the-fly image conversion. 

# Dependencies
To be added later.

# Stack
1. React + MUI
2. C++ Crow REST API
