# Manga Idea
A manga server I'm working on just for fun, just like [Komga](https://github.com/gotson/komga/) made in C++.\
It's made with the goal to be as feature rich as Komga, while being extremely efficient in memory/cpu usage.\
I plan on adding features that Komga simply won't support such as simple folders instead of pdf/archives.\
Future plans could include making an extension for tachiyomi to be used with the server, however it's currently low priority.\
I made it with the intent to learn C++, so expect low quality code. Pull requests and enhancements are welcome!

# Goals
1. Achieve good performance like Komga.
2. Good reading experience on the frontend.
3. Stability, and rare crashes.
4. Less than 10mb of memory usage.


# Status
The project is abandoned, still incomplete, but usable (kind of).\
Login, Registeration are working but user validation is not.\
Frontend is half baked.\
I got totally burned out with C++. It's not fun, and definitely got a whole lot harder the more I change anything in the backend.\
To be honest, golang seems quite close to C++ while also extremely simple and better in every way.\
I plan on remaking this project in golang in the near future.

# Dependencies
use VCPKG to download these dependencies:
1. RESTinio
2. LibArchive
3. Boost JSON
4. json_dto
5. libjxl (to decode image properties of JPEG XL)
6. sqlite_modern_cpp
7. Magick++ (Download the binery from magick website and make sure to include development libraries during installation).
8. fmt
9. jwt-cpp
10. openssl\
\
This project uses C++17.\
That's a long list, planning on shortening it later, development speed is the most important thing for now ðŸ¤©

# Stack
1. React + MUI
2. RESTinio Backend
