# Manga Idea
An attempt at rewriting Komga in C++. Note that Komga is extremely optimized, highly performant server.\
I probably will never reach the performance and usability of Komga, but it's not my goal.\
This is just a pet project, I wanted Komga to run with low memory usage, since JVM takes 500mb of memory minimum.\
I'm trying to learn C++, so I just had the idea of writing an alternative to Komga which I could use personally.\
So far it's been a breeze to develop, I'm quite impressed with the results so far.\
The project only uses 5-15 mb of Memory, which is just mindblowing compared to Komga.

# Objective
1. Performance.
2. Low memory footprint.

# Status
The project is in active development, still incomplete.
Around 30% is done? But it's not even usable.

# Dependencies
To be added later.

# Stack
1. React + MUI
2. C++ RESTinio
